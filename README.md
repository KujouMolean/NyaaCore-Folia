## Dependencies
- EssentialsX: soft depend. Used by `TeleportUtils`, with Essentials install, players can use `/back` command to return to the position before teleportion.
- Vault: soft depend. It's fine as long as you don't touch `VaultUtils`. If any downstream plugins what to use that, that plugin **MUST** list `Vault` as a required dependency.
